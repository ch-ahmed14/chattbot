finally id like to thank all the people who have helped me both directly and indirectly general introduction 1  p a g e general introduction in the age of the digital banking industry and online transactions information privacy is a paramount concern bank handle big amount of very sensitive data including personal and financial data of their customers maintaining the confidentiality and security of this information is essential to foster trust and ensure the integrity and cybersecurity defences are imperative to safeguard against breaches and cyberattacks that compromise customer privacy and lead to significant financial losses to enhance information security and mitigate financial risks banks often implement know your customer kyc procedures kyc is a set of regulations and processes that require banks to verify the identity of their customers understand their financial activities and assess potential risks associated with those customers kyc measures are not only crucial for regulatory compliance but also serve as a vital component in the protection of customer data and financial assets by ensuring that customers are who they claim to be and that their transactions are legitimate kyc plays a critical role in maintaining the privacy security and overall stability of the banking industry contextually  our final year internship project kyc platform  will automatise the process of validating information generating xml codes and saving it in the database and so on in the first chapter we will present the host company the project that we are working on and the methodology that  while in the second one will deal with the presentation of the global conceptual study actors and function and non function requirements that we have also we presented the technologies and work tool we are using and sprint planning we have moving on to fist sprint that we specifically provide the question management through the diagrams description and scenarios that we have next thing we will present the second sprint answer management through the diagrams description and scenarios we provided additionally we have third sprint that specified for form management that we will present it through diagrams description and scenarios we have and finally we have the last sprint xml generation and management we will present xml schema for fatca and cr schapter 1 project context 1  p a g e chapter 1 project context introduction in this first chapter i will first introduce my host company  followed by a brief description of the project i worked on we will also present the study of existent and finally well pose a few problems and propose the solutions which we will be describing throughout this document 11 company presentation in order to carry out a high quality project it is often essential to draw up a comprehensive study of the host organization this section is devoted to presentation of the hydatis company figure 1 shows the hydatis logo hydatis a dynamic consulting and services company it engineering its mission is to support its customers and partners in the implementation of efficient and innovative solutions in the fields of administration finance and industry 111 hydatis activities services are at the heart of hydatis approach as a true research and hydatis team provides high value added services in the fields of embedded systems information systems and mobility applications the hydatis offering is characterized by a high level of productivity capitalization on experience and a customer oriented approach thanks to the technological expertise of its teams in the field of information systems hydatis advises and works in close collaboration with its customers respecting their co nstraints in terms of cost chapter 1 project context 2  p a g e performance and efficiency respecting their constraints in terms of costs and deadlines to transform their visions into into reality hydatis teams help their customers with the functional aspects of their tools tools a network of it services partners and business experts are at their disposal to their customers various needs 112 organizational structure hydatis engineering limited liability company  llc  incorporated in 2020 figure 2 shows the hydatis organization chart figure 1 hydatis organization chart according to figure 2 here are the main responsibilities associated with each position within the company position primary role chief executive officer ceo oversees and directs the companys global strategy marketing manager develops and implements marketing strategies  sales manager leads the sales team and builds relationships with customers head of research and development rd guide the research and development of new products and services  financial manager manages the companys finances and financial strategy  administrative manager oversees administrative functions and regulatory compliance  table 1company roles 12 project presentation 121 problematic the facta system are all manual and are facing a lot of problem like delay ing and backlog ging the manual document verification process which is time consumi ng also we can mention that human interfering in the process can lead to compliance violation and potential fraud incidents chapter 1 project context 3  p a g e 122 study of existence we have identified three products have some similarity in the way of business model that we are aiming for in our project sumsub  sumsub is an identity verification and compliance platform used by businesses to streamline customer onboarding and meet regulatory requirements onfido  onfido is another identity verification platform that uses ai and machine learning to verify identities it enables businesses to verify the identities of their users by analyzing various documents such as ids passports or drivers licenses and biometric data  plaid  plaid is a different kind of platform compared to sumsub and onfido its a data connectivity platform that enables applications to connect with users bank accounts it offers apis that allow developers to integrate banking and financial data into their applications securely  123 proposed solution base d on what we provide in the study of existence and the problematic that we had  we conclude that we dont have a specific solution for our product that is why hydatis provided this solution which is kyc platform that can identify verify and export a suitable xml report with irs rules for every year 13 used methodology as far as it projects are concerned the methodologies used have evolved considerably evolved weve gone from classic methodologies to highly advanced ones designed to meet certain needs and solve relevant problems 131 different methodologies presentation older methodologies boil down to cascading development cycles which have many negative points they require the customers requirements to be requirements to be complete and defined at the outset of the project which means that a lot of documentation in addition quality control is only carried out at the end of the cycle at the end of the cycle all this adds up to a higher failure rate for the projects in question the emergence of new methodologies has solved some of these problems these methodologies known as agile give greater importance to the individuals involved in the chapter 1 project context 4  p a g e project reinforcing collaboration and avoiding a purely solely on the process to achieve this waterfall development cycles have been replaced by incremental and iterative cycles in addition to this these methodologies are minimalist and open to change they also enable problems to be detected problems early in the project while providing continuous improvements 132 scrum scrum is simple try it as is and determine if its philosophy theory and structure help to achieve goals and create value the scrum framework is purposefully incomplete only defining the parts required to implement scrum theory scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it rather than provide people with detailed instructions the rules of scrum guide their relationships and interactions 1 during my internship i adopted the agile methodology called scrum this methodology enables us to maintain good communication between the members of the team working on our project  but also to improve the project in a simple way to be able to follow this methodology you need to start by knowing the role of each member since the scrum process clearly defines everyones role as well as the overall way in which the project is managed the project team is made up of four members the product owner is responsible for the application defining requirements and deciding on the direction the platform will take then theres the scrum master who is the guarantor of the scrum methodology his role is to figure 2scrum methodology chapter 1 project context 5  p a g e ensure that the methodology is respected and properly applied by resolving any problems that may arise and maintaining communication with the entire team finally the development team which is responsible for producing the product in question role full name responsibility product owner mme ikbel souelmi defining the product vision development team rakrouki sabri myself  develop all parts of the application front end and back end  manage application architecture scrum master mme samia zammouri  ensure that the team follows scrum principles  facilitate scrum meetings such as the sprint planning meeting sprint review and retrospective  help resolve obstacles that the teams progress table 2scrum team presentation conclusion in this chapter we presented the host organization also we presented the study of existent and finally we presented the problem and proposed solution that we will solve in the next chapter we will present conceptual study of and methodology we worked withchapter 2 project analysis 6  p a g e chapter 2 sprint 0 project analysis introduction in this chapter we will present project analysis start with actor identification where we will define the actor that we have in our application move forward to function requirements and nonfunction requirements  global class diagram after that we will present the product backlog also we will present the technologies and tools we will use in the development of this project and the application architecture we had we will finish by the print planning we have 21 functional part 211 actor identification we have identified three actors in our project that they have some privilege visitor a visitor that he can access the first login page and authenticate in our project admin  an admin who has the dashboard to manage the data that we have in the project and export the xml report manually and consult the other data simple user a simple user he can answer the quiz and upload the document that he has a simple user can be an individual or an entity 212 function requirement during the discussion phase the following needs were identified  question management  this model allows you to create modify and delete a question from the quizs pages  answer management  this module allows you modify and delete an answer from database  forms management  this module allows you to auto identification modify delete and verify multiple form on dashboard   xml report generation and management  this module allows you to auto generate yearly and manually and delete an xml report 213 nonfunction requirement nonfunctional requirements guarantee that the platform will function correctly following implementation of the functional requirements we have concluded that the platform must meet the following requirements chapter 2 project analysis 7  p a g e  performance our project verifies and prosses the given information within seconds  scalability  the platform can handle multiple requests without impacting the response time  ergonomic  our platform uses user friendly interface and web base applications that make run at any device  flexibility  our platform gives the administrator the ability to configure the question through an easy interface and give the developer an easy written code with clean code rules to maintain 214 global use case diagram figure 3 global use case diagram

technologies and tools weve employed we will unveil the logical and physical architecture for the development of our application 221 technologies java is an object oriented language which means all programs are made of entities representing concepts or physical things known as objects java programs are found in desktops servers mobile devices smart cards and bluray discs bd 2 chapter 2 project analysis 10  p a g e spring boot is an open source java based framework used to create a micro service  it is developed by pivotal team and is used to build stand alone and production ready spring applications this chapter will give you an introduction to spring boot and familiarizes you with its basic concepts 3 kafka is a distributed event store and stream processing platform it is an open  source system developed by the apache software foundation written in java and scala 4 angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single page apps 5 cqrs pattern command query responsibility segregation cqrs is the segregation of the responsibilities of the commands and queries in a system that means that were slicing our application logic vertically in addition to that were segregating state mutation command handling from the data retrieval query handling 6 222 work tools intellij idea is an integrated development environment ide written in java for developing computer software written in java kotlin  groovy  and other jvmbased languages it is developed by jetbrains 7 chapter 2 project analysis 11  p a g e postgresql is an advanced enterprise class open source relational database that supports both sql relational and json non relational querying it is a highly stable database management system 8 mongodb is a source available cross platform document oriented database program classified as a nosql database program mongodb uses json like documents with optional schemas 9 microsoft azure  often referred to as azure is a cloud computing platform run by microsoft  it offers access management and the development of applications and services through global data centres  10 223 application architectures on this figure right blow we have the entities that we worked with through this project  chapter 2 project analysis 12  p a g e 2231 microservice architecture microservices are a service oriented architecture model in which applications are built by grouping together several small independent service units this software engineering approach emphasizes the decomposition of an application into single function modules each with clearly defined interfaces illustrates a microservices based architecture figure 4 microservice architecture the architecture of the kyc platform application illustrated in figure 4 is based on the principle of microservices architecture microservices architecture this modular design makes it possible to break down the applications key functionalities into a series of independent microservices the advantages of this approach are multiple  reducing dependency  by isolating the various functionalities into autonomous microservices we prevent the system from becoming too interdependent this reduces the risk of cascading errors and makes it easier to maintain and upgrade each service individually  improved availability chapter 2 project analysis 13  p a g e each microservice can be deployed scaled and maintained independently of the others this means that a failure in one service will not directly affect the others which resilience and overall system availability in this architecture we note the presence of the following elements  spring boot backend microservices these elements form the functional core of the application they represent the various modules that work independently guaranteeing a high degree of modularity and flexibility  microservice api gateway serves as a single point of entry for all requests from the frontend this microservice orchestrates and directs requests to the appropriate microservices facilitating managing and securing interactions between the frontend and microservices  angular frontend the frontend is built using the angular framework this technical choice enables us to create a responsive modern user interface capable of efficiently consuming the apis exposed by the api gateway in summary the microservices architecture implemented for the kyc platform  application favors better dependency management and a significant improvement in availability while enabling fluid and secure integration thanks to the api gateway microservice and a dynamic frontend developed with angular 2232 global architecture the microservices architecture will be adopted for our application because of its many advantages including the ability to manage complex scalable applications this approach offers benefits such as the possibility of using heterogeneous technologies increased resistance to failure and ease of deployment for exchanges between microservices we opted for  the event sourcing pattern a microservice architecture built around an event driven approach this guarantees the modularity scalability and stability of our platform event sourcing is a powerful architectural model that records all changes to an chapter 2 project analysis 14  p a g e applications state as a sequence of events in the chronological order in which they were applied  the cqrs command and query responsibility segregation approach in conjunction with event sourcing this model separates the logic of order processing from that of query processing by separating commands and queries the cqrs model enables developers to use different models for reading and writing data commands write updates to the corresponding topics while queries use consumers to create data projections in the topics  for data management we have chosen to adopt a polyglot persistence approach in line with the cqrs approach we have divided data persistence into a read database and a write database to facilitate fluid access to the same data source whats more this approach allows multiple data sources to be used within the same microservice figure 5 describes the overall architecture of our application figure 5 global architecture chapter 2 project analysis 15  p a g e 2233 logic architecture figure 6logic architecture angular follows the mvvm model view model view architecture as follows  model represented by a class that is referenced by the data access layer typescript class or interface  view o contains the layout and appearance visible to the user o reacts to user interactions such as clicks inputs etc  model view replaces the controller in mvc model view controller architecture connected to the view via data binding in angular it is represented by a nomcomponentts file the following layers are available for spring boot command layer  command handling  responsible for receiving and handling commands that change the state of the system  converts commands into domain events  typically involves command validation authorization and dispatching to the appropriate domain service or aggregate domain layer chapter 2 project analysis 16  p a g e  contains the core business logic and domain entities  handles domain events and updates the state of aggregatesentities  enforces business rules and invariants event layer  event handling  captures and processes domain events  responsible for updating read models or projections  may involve handling compensating events in case of failures event store  persists domain events in an event store  retrieves events for replay and projection  often used in event sourcing to rebuild the state of aggregates command bus  dispatches commands to the appropriate command handlers  may involve asynchronous communication for better scalability query layer  query handling  handles read requests by querying read models or projections  optimized for fast retrieval of data  decoupled from the command layer to support cqrs read model  projection layer  contains denormalized data optimized for specific read operations  updated asynchronously in response to domain events  supports efficient queries for read operations event bus  message broker  facilitates communication between different parts of the system using events  decouples producers and consumers of events  ensures that events are delivered reliably infrastructure layer  contains infrastructure related concerns such as database access messaging and external services integration  provides implementations for event stores message brokers and other external dependencies application layer  glues together the different layers  orchestrates the flow of commands events and queries  typically contains application services that coordinate the interaction between the domain and the infrastructure chapter 2 project analysis 17  p a g e api layer  exposes apis for external clients or other services to interact with the application  includes restful endpoints graphql or other communication mechanisms configuration layer  handles configuration of the application components  manages external configurations and dependencies 224 sprints planning using the scrum method we had planned our sprints in time intervals according to the evaluation of each task  sprint 1 question management  sprint 2 answer management  sprint 3 form management  sprint 4 xml report and management conclusion in this chapter we had detail ed the functional part which includes the identification of the functional and non functional requirements of our solution and the identification of the stakeholders we then move on to the technical side of things with its various components we close this study

will be sent to the formcommandcontroller and will run an algorithm that will identify the best form suitable for use and will save the auto recommendation form into mongodb and produce auto recommendation form event to kafka following that formeventconsumerservice will consume and update postgresql database the algorithm we are using here will identify form base on the actor and he is answering score so based on that we are covering all the situations we have on this platform actor can be an entity or individual figure 34auto recommendation form chapter 5 sprint 3 form management

xml generation and management trough use case diagram serval sequence diagram scenario class diagram and user interfaces from the project general conclusion 53  p a g e general conclusion the modern banking system operates within a framework of regulatory compliance and customer due diligence to ensure financial transparency and security know your customer kyc guidelines form the cornerstone of this system requiring banks to verify and authenticate the identity of their clients assessing their risk profiles and monitoring transactions to prevent money laundering and financial crimes the foreign account tax compliance act fatca is a us regulation that obliges foreign financial institutions to report information about accounts held by us taxpayers to the internal revenue service irs to curb tax evasion similarly the common reporting standard crs is an international standard developed by the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd that requires participating countries to exchange financial information automatically to combat tax evasion and ensure tax compliance globally together these regulatory frameworks establish protocols for banks to collect maintain and share crucial information fostering greater transparency and accountability in the global financial system while addressing tax related challenges across borders in this context our project objectives to make the whole process of kyc digital and easy for the client and workers in the fields with providing question management services that you can update the question regularly and answer management services that will help client with he is answer to recommend the best form that he will suitable him and form management that will help administrator to manage all the form and verify the document have been uploaded and xml generation and management service that will provide xml report on fatca or crs that irs demand him every year through this year i got familiar with the technologies that hydatis have been provide it for solving this problem which gave me opportunity to learn more about the fields and practices what i learned before and see it in real life for the project still in the beginning of the development will need more work on it to add more reliable feature like online sign in so we make it all process digitally or make a good script function that can scrap the whole information form the document that the client can provide biblography 54  p a g e bibliography 1 httpsscrumguidesorgscrum guidehtml 2 httpswwwtechopediacomdefinition3927java 3

very sensitive data including personal and financial data of their customers maintaining the confidentiality and security of this information is essential to foster trust and ensure the integrity and cybersecurity defences are imperative to safeguard against breaches and cyberattacks that compromise customer privacy and lead to significant financial losses to enhance information security and mitigate financial risks banks often implement know your customer kyc procedures kyc is a set of regulations and processes that require banks to verify the identity of their customers understand their financial activities and assess potential risks associated with those customers kyc measures are not only crucial for regulatory compliance but also serve as a vital component in the protection of customer data and financial assets by ensuring that customers are who they claim to be and that their transactions are legitimate kyc plays a critical role in maintaining the privacy security and overall stability of the banking industry contextually  our final year internship project kyc platform will automatise the process of validating information generating xml codes and saving it in the database and so on in the first chapter we will present the host company the project that we are working on and the methodology that  while in the second one will deal with the presentation of the global conceptual study actors and function and nonfunction requirements that we have also we presented the technologies and work tool we are using and sprint planning we have moving on to fist sprint that we specifically provide the question management through the diagrams description and scenarios that we have next thing we will present the second sprint answer management through the diagrams description and scenarios we provided additionally we have third sprint that specified for form management that we will present it through diagrams description and scenarios we have and finally we have the last sprint xml generation and management we will present xml schema for fatca and crs chapter 1 project context 1  p a g e chapter 1 project context introduction in this first chapter i will first introduce my host company followed by a brief description of the project i worked on we will also present the study of existent and finally well pose a few problems and propose the solutions which we will be describing throughout this document 11 company presentation in order to carry out a highquality project it is often essential to draw up a comprehensive study of the host organization this section is devoted to presentation of the hydatis company figure 1 shows the hydatis logo hydatis a dynamic consulting and services company it engineering its mission is to support its customers and partners in the implementation of efficient and innovative solutions in the fields of administration finance and industry 111 hydatis activities services are at the heart of hydatis approach as a

directs the companys global strategy marketing manager develops and implements marketing strategies sales manager leads the sales team and builds relationships with customers head of research and development rd guide the research and development of new products and services financial manager manages the companys finances and financial strategy administrative manager oversees administrative functions and regulatory compliance table 1company roles 12 project presentation 121 problematic the facta system are all manual and are facing a lot of problem like delaying and backlogging the manual document verification process which is timeconsuming also we can mention that human interfering in the process can lead to compliance violation and potential fraud incidents chapter 1 project context 3  p a g e 122 study of existence we have identified three products have some similarity in the way of business model that we are aiming for in our project sumsub sumsub is an identity verification and compliance platform used by businesses to streamline customer onboarding and meet regulatory requirements onfido onfido is another identity verification platform that uses ai and machine learning to verify identities it enables businesses to verify the identities of their users by analyzing various documents such as ids passports or drivers licenses and biometric data plaid plaid is a different kind of platform compared to sumsub and onfido its a data connectivity platform that enables applications to connect with users bank accounts it offers apis that allow developers to integrate banking and financial data into their applications securely 123 proposed solution based on what we provide in the study of existence and the problematic that we had we conclude that we dont have a specific solution for our product that is why hydatis provided this solution which is kyc platform that can identify verify and export a suitable xml report with irs rules for every year 13 used methodology as far as it projects are concerned the methodologies used have evolved considerably evolved weve gone from classic methodologies to highly advanced ones designed to meet certain needs and solve relevant problems 131 different methodologies presentation older methodologies boil down to cascading development cycles which have many negative points they require the customers requirements to be requirements to be complete and defined at the outset of the project which means that a lot of documentation in addition quality control is only carried out at the end of the cycle at the end of the cycle all this adds up to a higher failure rate for the projects in question the emergence of new methodologies has solved some of these problems these methodologies known as agile give greater importance to the individuals involved in the chapter 1 project context 4  p a g e project reinforcing collaboration and avoiding a purely solely on the process to achieve this waterfall development cycles have been replaced by incremental and iterative cycles in addition to this these methodologies are minimalist and open to change they also enable problems to be detected problems early in the project while providing continuous improvements 132 scrum scrum is simple try it as is and determine if its philosophy theory and structure help to achieve goals and create value the scrum framework is purposefully incomplete only defining the parts required to implement scrum theory scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it rather than provide people with detailed instructions the rules of scrum guide their relationships and interactions1 during my internship i adopted the agile methodology called scrum this methodology enables us to maintain good communication between the members of the team working on our project but also to improve the project in a simple way to be able to follow this methodology you need to start by knowing the role of each member since the scrum process clearly defines everyones role as well as the overall way in which the project is managed the project team is made up of four members the product owner is responsible for the application defining requirements and deciding on the direction the platform will take then theres the scrum master who is the guarantor of the scrum methodology his role is to figure 2scrum methodology chapter 1 project context 5  p a g e ensure that the methodology is respected and properly applied by resolving any problems that may arise and maintaining communication with

this chapter we presented the host organization also we presented the study of existent and finally we presented the problem and proposed solution that we will solve in the next chapter we will present conceptual study of and methodology we worked with chapter 2 project analysis 6  p a g e chapter 2 sprint 0project analysis introduction in this chapter we will present project analysis start with actor identification where we will define the actor that we have in our application move forward to function requirements and nonfunction requirements  global class diagram after that we will present the product backlog also we will present the technologies and tools we will use in the development of this project and the application architecture we had we will finish by the print planning we have 21 functional part 211 actor identification we have identified three actors in our project that they have some privilege visitor a visitor that he can access the first login page and authenticate in our project admin  an admin who has the dashboard to manage the data that we have in the project and export the xml report manually and consult the other data simple user a simple user he can answer the quiz and upload the document that he has a simple user can be an individual or an entity 212 function requirement during the discussion phase the following needs were identified  question management this model allows you to create modify and delete a question from the quizs pages  answer management this module allows you modify and delete an answer from database  forms management this module allows you to auto identification modify delete and verify multiple form on dashboard  xml report generation and management this module allows you to auto generate yearly and manually and delete an xml report 213 nonfunction requirement nonfunctional requirements guarantee that the platform will function correctly following implementation of the functional requirements we have concluded that the platform must meet the following requirements chapter 2 project analysis 7  p a g e  performance our project verifies and prosses the given information within seconds  scalability the platform can handle multiple requests without impacting the response time  ergonomic our platform uses user friendly interface and web base applications that make run at any device

application architectures on this figure right blow we have the entities that we worked with through this project chapter 2 project analysis 12  p a g e 2231 microservice architecture microservices are a serviceoriented architecture model in which applications are built by grouping together several small independent service units this software engineering approach emphasizes the decomposition of an application into singlefunction modules each with clearly defined interfaces illustrates a microservicesbased architecture figure 4 microservice architecture the architecture of the kyc platform application illustrated in figure 4 is based on the principle of microservices architecture microservices architecture this modular design makes it possible to break down the applications key functionalities into a series of independent microservices the advantages of this approach are multiple  reducing dependency by isolating the various functionalities into autonomous microservices we prevent the system from becoming too interdependent this reduces the risk of cascading errors and makes it easier to maintain and upgrade each service individually  improved availability chapter 2 project analysis 13  p a g e each microservice can be deployed scaled and maintained independently of the others this means that a failure in one service will not directly affect the others which resilience and overall system availability in this architecture we note the presence of the following elements  spring boot backend microservices these elements form the functional core of the application they represent the various modules that work independently guaranteeing a high degree of modularity and flexibility  microservice api gateway serves as a single point of entry for all requests from the frontend this microservice orchestrates and directs requests to the appropriate microservices facilitating managing and securing interactions between the frontend and microservices  angular frontend the frontend is built using the angular framework this technical choice enables us to create a responsive modern user interface capable of efficiently consuming the apis exposed by the api gateway in summary the microservices architecture implemented for the kyc platform application favors better dependency management and a significant improvement in availability while enabling fluid and secure integration thanks to the api gateway microservice and a dynamic frontend developed with angular 2232 global architecture the microservices architecture will be adopted for our application because of its many advantages including the ability to manage complex scalable applications this approach offers benefits such as the possibility of using heterogeneous technologies increased resistance to failure and ease of deployment for exchanges between microservices we opted for  the event sourcing pattern a microservice architecture built around an eventdriven approach this guarantees the modularity scalability and stability of our platform event sourcing is a powerful architectural model that records all changes to an chapter 2 project analysis 14  p a g e applications state as a sequence of events in the chronological order in which they were applied  the cqrs command and query responsibility segregation approach in conjunction with event sourcing this model separates the logic of order processing from that of query processing by separating commands and queries the cqrs model enables developers to use different models for reading and writing data commands write updates to the corresponding topics while queries use consumers to create data projections in the topics  for data management we have chosen to adopt a polyglot persistence approach in line with the cqrs approach we have divided data persistence into a read database and a write database to facilitate fluid access to the same data source whats more this approach allows multiple data sources to be used within the same microservice figure 5 describes the overall architecture of our application figure 5 global architecture chapter 2 project analysis 15  p a g e 2233 logic architecture figure 6logic architecture angular follows the mvvm modelviewmodelview architecture as follows  model represented by a class that is referenced by the data access layer typescript class

architecture connected to the view via data binding in angular it is represented by a nomcomponentts file the following layers are available for spring boot command layer  command handling  responsible for receiving and handling commands that change the state of the system  converts commands into domain events  typically involves command validation authorization and dispatching to the appropriate domain service or aggregate domain layer chapter 2 project analysis 16  p a g e  contains the core business logic and domain entities  handles domain events and updates the state of aggregatesentities  enforces business rules and invariants event layer  event handling  captures and processes domain events  responsible for updating read models or projections  may involve handling compensating events in case of failures event store  persists domain events in an event store  retrieves events for replay and projection  often used in event sourcing to rebuild the state of aggregates command bus  dispatches commands to the appropriate command handlers  may involve asynchronous communication for better scalability query layer  query handling  handles read requests by querying read models or projections  optimized for fast retrieval of data  decoupled from the command layer to support cqrs read model  projection layer  contains denormalized data optimized for specific read operations  updated asynchronously in response to domain events  supports efficient queries for read operations event bus  message broker  facilitates communication between different parts of the system using events  decouples producers and consumers of events  ensures that events are delivered reliably infrastructure layer  contains infrastructurerelated concerns such as database access messaging and external services integration  provides implementations for event stores message brokers and other external dependencies application layer  glues together the different layers  orchestrates the flow of commands events and queries  typically contains application services that coordinate the interaction between the domain and the infrastructure chapter 2 project analysis 17  p

generation and management trough use case diagram serval sequence diagram scenario class diagram and user interfaces from the project general conclusion 53  p a g e general conclusion the modern banking system operates within a framework of regulatory compliance and customer due diligence to ensure financial transparency and security know your customer kyc guidelines form the cornerstone of this system requiring banks to verify and authenticate the identity of their clients assessing their risk profiles and monitoring transactions to prevent money laundering and financial crimes the foreign account tax compliance act fatca is a us regulation that obliges foreign financial institutions to report information about accounts held by us taxpayers to the internal revenue service irs to curb tax evasion similarly the common reporting standard crs is an international standard developed by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd that requires participating countries to exchange financial information automatically to combat tax evasion and ensure tax compliance globally together these regulatory frameworks establish protocols for banks to collect maintain and share crucial information fostering greater transparency and accountability in the global financial system while addressing taxrelated challenges across borders in this context our project objectives to make the whole process of kyc digital and easy for the client and workers in the fields with providing question management services that you can update the question regularly and answer management services that will help client with he is answer to recommend the best form that he will suitable him and form management that will help administrator to manage all the form and verify the document have been uploaded and xml generation and management service that will provide xml report on fatca or crs that irs demand him every year through this year i got familiar with the technologies that hydatis have been provide it for solving this problem which gave me opportunity to learn more about the fields and practices what i learned before and see it in real life for the project still in the beginning of the development will need more work on it to add more reliable feature like online sign in so we make it all process digitally or make a good script function that can scrap the whole information form the document that the client can provide biblography 54  p a g e bibliography 1 httpsscrumguidesorgscrumguidehtml 2 httpswwwtechopediacomdefinition3927java 3
